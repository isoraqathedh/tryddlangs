# conlangs
--------------------------
Hello dear visitor!

My name's tryddle and in this repository I will upload monthly updates on my conlang *Hapi*, or more specifically, on its documentation. I've been conlanging for about 3Â½ years now and it's always been dear to my heart. I write my reference grammar using the markup language LaTeX. I might also add other conlang in the future, but right now I'll be concentrating on aforementioned *Hapi*.

Cheers!
